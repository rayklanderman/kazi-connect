**Note:** This project uses Supabase only. Any references to Firebase in earlier versions are obsolete.

### Security & Secrets
- All secrets (API keys, Supabase credentials) must be stored in `.env`, which is already included in `.gitignore`.
- **Never** commit your `.env` or any secret keys to the repository.
- The `.env.example` file provides a template but does not contain real credentials.

### .gitignore
This project includes a comprehensive `.gitignore` to avoid committing sensitive files, node_modules, build output, and environment variables.
